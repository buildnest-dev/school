## **Laravel School Management System: Indian Edition**

An India-localised version of **LAVSMS** (Laravel 8), originally created by Chinedu Okemiri ("CJ Inspired") and released under the MIT License (see `LICENSE`). Original project: https://github.com/4jean/lav_sms

### What was localised
- Currency: Naira (N) replaced by the Rupee sign (₹) on fee, payment, receipt and marksheet screens
- Location: 28 States and 8 Union Territories; "LGA" is now **District** (starter list of major districts per state; extend `database/seeders/LgasTableSeeder.php`)
- Classes: Nursery, LKG, UKG, Class 1 to 12 (class-type codes unchanged, so marks logic is the same)
- Grading: CBSE-style A1 to E scale out of 100 (editable under Grades)
- Timezone Asia/Kolkata, Faker locale en_IN, sample names, hostels ("Houses"), phone, address and fee defaults
- NOT changed: database table and column names (`lgas`, `lga_id`), so the original migrations still apply

### Status
Not run or tested yet: PHP, Composer and MySQL are not installed on this machine. Follow the installation steps below and run `php artisan test` before relying on it.
